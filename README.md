# Forgery Recognition

The project is broken into three parts, each part run individually.
1. *GAN:* Follow the Baseline Gan letter generator code jupyter notebook or run the notebook step-by-step
2. *Siamese Network:* Follow the Siamese network jupyter notebook
3. *Convolutional GAN:* Refer to the README within the CNN_GAN folder

Content of other folders:
* `generated_images`: GAN and CNN_GAN generated images, alongside the original EMNIST words
* `siamese`: forgery data for the Siamese model
* `letter_recognition`: deprecated, not used
* `scribe`: examples generated from [Graves' LSTM implementation](https://github.com/greydanus/scribe)
