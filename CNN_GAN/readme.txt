To run:
	Just run word_gen, if you want to create different words change the bottom of the script to do so

	Do not run CNN.py unless you want to retrain the CNN (the saved files have ~95% accuracy so not necessary). If you wish to run CNN.py you either need tensorflow 1.15.0 
	or replace the keras calls with tensorflow.keras calls instead. 
	
	model_test.py is to see how well the model predicts random characters. You can try this or load in your own images to try.
